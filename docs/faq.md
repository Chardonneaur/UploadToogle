## FAQ

__Which problem does this plugin solve?__

By default, within Matomo on-premise, you cannot upload plugins through the backend of Matomo. In order to overcome this, you need to edit the config.ini.php file. The issue is that some people do not have access to the server, as a result, they cannot upload a plugin which is not listed on the marketplace. The Upload Toogle plugin allows you to simply edit the config.ini.php file without accessing to the server.
