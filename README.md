# Upload Toogle

## Description

Inspired from the Development Toogle of Lukas Winkler, this plugin adds a new icon to the main navigation bar for super admins that quickly enable the possibility to upload plugins from the Matomo backend.

Typically this plugin acts on the config.ini.php file by setting the following variable enable_plugin_upload to 1. By default it is set on 0.
